# plot_tool
A data visualization tool to speed up the development process.

### Ambition
An application runnable on different platforms, to which you can send plot commands through IPC, from different programming languages. The only required integration to the 'Application Under Test' shall be including a header only library, thus eliminating the need for integrating and running a 'heavy' GUI/data visualization library into your application.

### State of the code
The code is currently a bit of a mess. Looking for people who can help make it better, add functionality and clean up the code.
